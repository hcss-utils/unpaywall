While within societies income and life satisfaction are positively correlated there is no increase in life satisfaction across time when average income across decades rises. (Easterlin, 1974) . Moreover, follow-up studies have shown further that the phenomenon that 'money does not buy happiness' exists in both developed and low-income countries (Di Tella & MacCulloch, 2008) . Their study argues that economic wealth is produced at the expense of resource depletion, environmental degradation and widening income inequality within society and it leads to lower wellbeing levels. As a result, mainstream literature on the causes of subjective well-being (SWB) has proliferated. One scholarly inquiry that is still in its infancy, nonetheless, is the link between governmental activities and life satisfaction. Some studies find a negative or insignificant association between government size and SWB 2 , while others suggest that government size increases life satisfaction.",

The neoclassical theory posits that government sector eliminates market failures by producing important public goods and maintains legal frameworks without which economy would not operate efficiently or not function at all (Blankart, 2003) . In contrast, public choice theory argues that public officials, administrators and bureaucrats as well as politicians tend to seek their personal advantage. Consequently, large public sector may cause excessively large budgets and excessive involvement in -and regulation of -the economy.",

For example, ample studies show that higher-IQ nations are associated with efficient bureaucracies and lower levels of corruption (Potrafke, 2012) , while other scholars confirm the significant associations between these variables and SWB. It is therefore possible that the impact of bureaucracy on citizens' wellbeing varies with nations' levels of cognitive ability. Moreover, there may very well be mutual interdependence between the size and efficiency of bureaucracy and national intelligence. For example, the ruling elite in cognitively able societies protect political rights and civil liberties and enhance the relative power of ordinary citizens (Rindermann et al., 2015) . In turn, more intelligent individuals who are more actively involved in political processes are more likely to prevent the ruling elite from expropriating resources to achieve personal gain from others without reciprocating any benefits to society through wealth creation. An intelligent electorate provides a check on fraudulent and incompetent bureaucrats and motivates them to distribute wealth more equally within society.",

                "text": "Intelligence, education and knowledge 'broaden man's outlook, enable him to understand the need for norms of tolerance, restrain him from adhering to extremist doctrines, and increase his capacity to make rational electoral choices' (Lipset, 1960) . As a result, 'stricter [political and societal] control might restrain bureaucrats' deleterious impact, lead to efficiency gains, and increase people's happiness' (Bj\u00f8rnskov, Dreher & Fischer, 2007, pp.270-271) . Therefore, in high-IQ nations, public policies are more in consonance with voters' preferences. It is important to highlight that there is evidence that intelligent voters tend to elect leaders with cognitive abilities of about 20 IQ points above their general electorate. Taking into account that efficiently functioning government institutions 'depend on a public who can process complex information and actively participate in politics,' we may anticipate that the effect of the public sector on life satisfaction depends on the level of national intelligence. Moreover, research shows that average intelligence of the ruling elite is positively correlated with economic success, moral standards in the government and state spending priorities (Simonton, 1985 (Simonton, , 2006a . For example, governments in countries with higher IQs tend to devote less public resources to military spending (Salahodjaev, 2016) , ratify international environmental agreements more frequently (Obydenkova & Salahodjaev, 2016) , are more likely to invest in health care (Lv & Xu, 2016) and exhibit greater concern for less privileged share of population (Salahodjaev & Azam, 2015) . As suggested by Bj\u00f8rnskov et al. (2007) 'the more efficiently the government produces, the less tax payers' money is wasted, and, consequently, the more beneficial is the trade-off between taxes and public spending from the citizens' perspective'. Therefore may hypothesize that the effect of government size on SWB depends positively on the effectiveness of public sector, degree of political accountability and competition and civic participation of citizens, captured by national intelligence levels.",

Table 3 presents the correlation matrix and shows the economic development, cognitive abilities and a binary variable for African countries is highly correlated with SWB. On the other hand the correlation between government size and SWB is somewhat lower (r = .29***), further reinforcing the findings presented in Figure 1 . Moreover, the correlation coefficients reported in Table 3 do not signal evidence of potential multicollinearity in our multivariate regression analysis. Table 4 presents the estimates of the multiple regression analysis of SWB, intelligence and government size. Column 1 presents a bivariate specification in which we use government size as the only regressor for life satisfaction. As expected, we find that government size is positively associated with life satisfaction. In particular, when government final consumption expenditure increases by one standard deviation, the life satisfaction index increases by nearly 0.5 points (slightly less than a half standard deviation). In column 2, government size loses its significance once we add intelligence to the model. On the other hand, the estimate for national IQ is positive and statistically significant at the 1% level.

Tables 5, 6 , and 7 present results from robustness tests. In Table 5 , we include additional control variables to avoid omitted variable bias. The extra control variables include GDP per capita growth, unemployment rate, latitude and share of population living in the tropics. The data on GDP per capita growth and unemployment rate are from the World Bank, while geographic variables are from Nunn and Puga (2012) . This robustness test confirms the baseline results. As an alternative robustness test, we re-estimate our baseline model (Table 4) for different time periods. In column 1 of Table 6 , we take the average size of the government for the period 2000-2015, while column 2 reports the estimates for the period from 2005 to 2015. Again, the results are nearly identical to our baseline coefficients. Table 7 reports the results for different subsamples of countries. In columns 1 and 2, we exclude countries with a population of less than 1 million citizens and greater than 100 million citizens. Columns 3 and 4 present the results when we exclude the poorest (GDP per capita less than 500 USD) and the richest (greater than 100,000 USD) countries in our sample. Finally, in column 5, we take into account the potential role of geography by controlling for continental dummies for Asia, Europe, Oceania, and North and South America. ",

                "text": "While some studies report that cognitive abilities are causal to the wealth of nations (Lynn & Vanhanen, 2012) , some scholars argue that significant differences between countries and entire global regions in IQ scores are really just consequences of development that improves nutrition, life expectancy, and education (Barber, 2005) . Therefore, we test the robustness of main results by considering the correlation between intelligence and economic development. We apply an approach based on earlier cross-country studies to generate a variable that assesses the effect of GDP per capita that seems to be irrelevant to the level of cognitive abilities. We regressed GDP per capita on IQs and generated the residuals. These residuals represent the international differences in economic development that cannot be predicted by average national cognitive abilities. The results are reported in column 1 of Table 8 . The effect of government size and its interaction term with intelligence remains robust. In addition, unlike in baseline results, in column 2 we control for log-transformed GDP per capita. As it more closely approaches a Gaussian distribution and, more importantly, we can hypothesize that a rise of GDP by a constant fraction, rather than a constant absolute amount, is associated with a constant rise in SWB. The results for our main variable of interests remain robust. However, we also find that the coefficient for IQ is now statistically insignificant. This may be driven by two reasons. First, GDP per capita moderates the link between IQ and life satisfaction. On the other hand, there may be another variable which is now stronger correlated with log transformed GDP per capita and IQ thus capturing part of the relationship. To find this variable we refer to existing literature. Extant literature argues that that measuring correct GDP per capita and its growth rates poses a significant problem for African countries (Andersen & Dalgaard, 2013) . In a similar vein, a number of studies argues that national IQs for African countries provided in Lynn and Vanhanen (2012) may contain measurement errors (Wicherts et al., 2010) . Therefore, in column 3 we drop a dummy variable for African countries from our regressions. Now the estimate for IQ is positive and significant at 5% level. Finally, one may argue that the effect of government size and its interaction with intelligence may depend on the choice of control variables. Some studies argue, that the interplay between political institutions and, related to it, the quality of government can be influenced by a number of historical factors (Lankina et. al. 2016a) as well as the role of international factors (Obydenkova & Libman 2012) . Indeed, some recent research demonstrated the impact of such factors as foreign trade, the role of the EU's projects and even geographic distances on political institutions and on political regime (Lankina et. al. 2016b) . In contrast, other studies specified the importance of socio-economic variables in the quality of governance and public policy that potentially may have effects on life-satisfaction of population at both national and subnational levels (Libman and Obydenkova 2014) . Obviously, we have to be selective in the number of control variables that might relate to life satisfaction in one econometric model. However, we estimate model robustness, using the mrobust command in Stata. This test which investigates the robustness of a model across possible combinations of specified model ingredients (such as control variables, estimation commands, etc.) and reports on the resulting distribution of estimates. As a choice of our additional control variables apart from base line controls, we also employ: average life expectancy (from World Bank), GDP growth rates (from World Bank), economic freedom index (from Heritage Foundation), unemployment rate (from World Bank), and inflation rate (from World Bank). Consequently, we estimate 4,096 potential models with up to 12 possible control terms. While there is high correlation between intelligence, government size and control variables, the estimate for government size was positive and significant in 98% of the cases. Turning to the estimate for interaction term, we find that the interactive effect of government size conditional on the cognitive abilities is positive and significant in approximately 67% of the regressions.",

The main goal of this study is to investigate one of the potential channels through which nations with higher cognitive capital achieve higher levels of life satisfaction. Indeed, we argue that the relationship between intelligence and life satisfaction at a national level is more complex. In particular, this study demonstrated that the effect of government policies, the ultimate goals of which are to improve citizens' wellbeing, is moderated by the psychological context within which political processes takes place.

Using data from 147 countries, we find that the interaction term between nation-IQ and government size is positive and significant, suggesting that government size increases life satisfaction most in high-IQ countries and least in countries with lower levels of cognitive abilities. One possible reason for this may be that, in countries with a larger state sector and greater cognitive capital, public policies are more in consonance with peoples' preferences, thus, leading in increase in life satisfaction. As a result, in high-IQ nations, state institutions are more efficient; bureaucrats do not engage in informal and corrupt activities (Potrafke, 2012; Salahodjaev, 2015) ; the optimal government size infers that the ruling elite are constrained from engaging in activities that impair life satisfaction of population and increase efficiency of bureaucrats.
