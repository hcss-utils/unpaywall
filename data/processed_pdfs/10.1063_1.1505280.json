    "abstract": "The Working Group on Women in Physics of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) subcontracted with the Statistical Research Center of the American Institute of Physics (AIP) to conduct an international study on women in physics. This study had two parts. First, we conducted a benchmarking study to identify reliable sources and collect data on the representation of women in physics in as many IUPAP member countries as possible. Second, we conducted an international survey of individual women physicists. The survey addressed issues related to both education and employment. On the education side, we asked about experiences and critical incidents from secondary school through the highest degree earned. On the employment side, we asked about how the respondents' careers had evolved and their selfassessment of how well their careers had progressed. In addition, the questionnaire also addressed issues that cut across education and employment, such as the impact of marriage and children, the factors that contributed the most toward the success they had achieved to date, and suggestions for what could be done to improve the situation of women physicists. HIGHLIGHTS \u2022 The report contains country-level data and anecdotal information about the representation of women in physics from 34 countries. \u2022 Most of the women physicists who responded to this survey reported that they developed an interest in physics during or before they were in secondary school. This emphasizes the importance of the opportunity to study physics and the encouragement to pursue science early in the academic system. \u2022 Respondents felt they had generally positive experiences as undergraduates and as graduate students. \u2022 About one-third of the women who responded felt that they had progressed more slowly in their careers than their colleagues had. \u2022 The demands of a career in physics seemed to preclude several of the women in our study from marrying or having children. Of those who are married, a significant number reported that marriage affected their work. When comparing themselves to their colleagues, women with children were more likely than women who do not have children to say their careers had progressed slowly. \u2022 The factor most frequently cited by women physicists as contributing to their success was the support of their families, including their parents and husbands. Many also mentioned the support of advisors, professors, and teachers, and some cited the support of colleagues. Also frequently mentioned were the women's own determination, will power, and hard work. \u2022 Barriers that the women mentioned included the problems of balancing the demands of child care with the demands of a scientific career. Another barrier was discriminatory attitudes, usually expressed in the form of assumptions that women cannot do physics. \u2022 Three out of four women who responded said that they would choose physics again.",

Thus, we relied on personal networks among women physicists in each IUPAP country. The team leaders in each country were asked to e-mail women physicists they knew in their countries. The latter were asked to complete the questionnaire and return it via e-mail to the Statistical Research Center, as well as to forward the questionnaire to other women physicists they knew. During the summer and early fall of 2001, Dr. Marcia Barbosa, chair of the Working Group, e-mailed team leaders in IUPAP countries on several occasions to encourage them to disseminate the questionnaire. We eventually received more than 1000 responses from women physicists in more than 50 countries. Table 2 shows the number of responses by country. ",

Thus, in some countries, the women who responded may overrepresent the number of women physicists who are academically employed.

Our husbands do not like housework at all and they are not ready to share the responsibilities. Hence, spending a lot of time in the house and [on] the children, women physicists have less time to work at the lab. Soon, they become less competitive. Sometimes they have not enough time to follow the new achievements, and slowly they convert to teachers only. Their research suffers. \" [Bulgaria] <( The odds are stacked against women very subtly and mostly in the form of guilt about neglect of family and children, from family and loved ones at home. That's a combination that's hard to beat. So some kind of awareness among the general public about why it's important for women to hold their jobs and make a mark is also an essential ingredient in getting more women into research, and keeping them there. \" [India] \"I think many of the problems stem from societal reasons, and these will probably iron out to some extent with time. We have different traditional systems, and they mostly place the women in caring roles (often confined to the home). These coexist with 'modern' roles, and the so-called 'career women' of today spend a good fraction of their energies trying to bridge the divide between what is expected of them at work and at home. Some of the compromises we must make don't earn us much credit in either sphere of action, and can be quite demoralizing!\" [India] \"Awareness should be aroused in the society regarding sharing of family responsibilities, so that it becomes easier for women scientists to balance family and career. \" [Pakistan] \"Since all the burden of raising children falls on the shoulders of the women, there are small chances for them to progress at the same rate as men in the same position. \" [Israel] \"I think that the situation for all women should be improved as the women are left almost all by themselves to raise the children, work, and take care of the house. \" [Brazil] \"I believe it is a social problem, not directly related to physics. As long as the housework and children care will not be equally shared by men and women, it will be considerably more difficult for women to be successful in a career, whatever this career is. \" [France] Unfortunately, the culture of physics includes the requirement that physicists work long hours. With this comes the related belief that anyone who has to limit her work time is less productive. Women are keenly aware of these beliefs. Some react by concluding that work and family are incompatible and choose to leave physics (unfortunately these women could not be included in this study). Some chose career over family and made the choice not to have children. More than two out of five of our respondents have not had children. Of those older than 45, more than onefifth have not had children.",

In short, they are a remarkably valuable resource for the educational systems and the economies of their countries.We asked women physicists if they would choose physics again. Three out of four replied that they would. One of the goals of the conference was to identify ways to get this number closer to 100%. Another goal was to identify the changes that will make it possible for the next generation of women physicists to succeed in school and to have the opportunity to successfully pursue careers in physics.Many women succeed in physics despite tremendous obstacles. All over the world, women physicists report similar barriers to their success. The cultural pressure to be caretakers of children conflicts with the scientific pressures of physics. Women also face barriers in the form of strongly held beliefs that women are incapable of doing good science.However, women also report similar keys to success regardless of their country. Over and over again, women mentioned the support of others-families, husbands, teachers, advisors, and colleagues-as integral to their success. There is also the continual reference to women's own strength and determination in the face of barriers. These women relied on themselves and on others, and became successful physicists.\"Physics is a subject I love very much and I don 7 think I can stop learning new things about physics.\" [Nigeria] \"I think physics is a fantastic thing to do. \" [Sweden] ",
