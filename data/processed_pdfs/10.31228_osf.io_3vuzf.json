When it was revealed that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by, among other things, hacking into the e-mail system of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and releasing its e-mails, international lawyers were divided over whether the cyber attack violated international law. President Obama seemingly went out of his way to describe the attack as a mere violation of \"established international norms of behavior\" and pointedly declined to refer to the cyber attacks as a violation of international law. ' Some international lawyers were more willing to describe the cyber attack as a violation of international law. 2 However, identifying the exact legal norm that was contravened turns out to be harder than it might otherwise appear. To the layperson, the Russian hacking constituted an impermissible (and perhaps) shocking interference in the American political process-an intervention that nonlawyers would not hesitate to label a \"violation of sovereignty\" as that term is used in political or diplomatic discourse. 3 The problem arises when one attempts to translate that commonsense intuition into legal discourse. At that point, the translation effort breaks down for a variety of reasons.",

For example, the Russian interference could simply be viewed as an act of espionage, but it has long been understood (at least until recent controversies in human rights law) that spying violates domestic-but not international-law. An alternative rubric would focus on the intervention aspect of Russia's behavior. The problem here is that the standard-though by no means universally accepted-definition for what counts as an illegal intervention requires doctrinal elements such as coercion that may not be present in this case. So too with regard to the notion of an illegal \"usurpation of an inherently governmental function,\" a legal description that is a poor fit for Russia's hacking during the 2016 election, for reasons that will be more fully articulated below.",

The lack of fit with the doctrinal requirements for an illegal intervention against another State's sovereignty is simply an indication that the notions of \"sovereignty\" and \"intervention\"-though mainstays of contemporary public international law doctrine-are poorly suited to analyzing the legality of the conduct in this case. A far better rubric for analyzing the behavior is the notion of self-determination, a legal concept that captures the right of a people to decide, for themselves, both their political arrangements (at a systematic level) and their future destiny (at a more granular level of policy). It is precisely this more basic right of self-determination that was violated by Russia's conduct. Unfortunately, the right of self-determination has largely lain fallow since the global process of decolonization was completed,' with the exception of a few cases of controversial secessions. 6 But the Russian hacking campaign is evidence that self-determination's departure from the scene in international law should be mourned and, if possible, reversed because there are situations and cases where the best legal categories for understanding the situation are not sovereignty and intervention but rather the frustratingly imprecise notion of self-determination. 7 Accordingly, this Article proceeds in three parts. Part I will analyze the law of espionage and spying, which are widespread practices in today's 5. For a longer discussion of this phenomenon, see Jens David Ohlin, The Right to Exist and the Right to Resist, in THE THEORY OF SELF-DETERMINATION 70, 72 (Fernando R. Teson ed., 2016) (describing self-determination as \"a right that is universally recognized as central and indisputable in international law, but unfortunately of very little practical significance\").",

The concept of coercion can be defined narrowly or broadly, with huge consequences for the outcome of the analysis in this case. Unfortunately, there is little in international law that outlines a complete theory of coercion-for that, one must look to philosophy. Finally, Part III will offer a conceptual argument that seeks to recast the sovereignty argument with a new legal architecture built from the raw materials of self-determination. The result of the argument is that the Russian cyber intervention in the 2016 election may very well have violated international law, but not for the reason that most lawyers assume. In making these arguments, the Article will make extensive reference to the Tallinn Manual on Cyber Operations, which offers the most up-to-date guidance on the law of cyber activities under international law.' Although some of the Manual's statements and conclusions of law are controversial, it is nonetheless undeniable that the document is the most complete rendering of an emerging (but not universal) consensus regarding the law in this area.",

This Article will assume that the hacking involved State action on the part of the Russian government, as opposed to private behavior. Also, this Article will assume that the attribution requirement is satisfied and that there is sufficient evidence to link the hacking with the Russian government. Moreover, in conducting the legal analysis, it is important to look at the entire event together rather than segmenting the Russian cyber interference into isolated behaviors. It is not just that the Russian government engaged in cyber intrusions against the DNC, that they disclosed e-mails to WikiLeaks, that they distributed the e-mails, that they did not engage in the same activity to the Grand Old Party, and that they deployed other cyber resources to spread fake news stories on social media.

First, human rights provisions were originally conceptualized as constraints against a government's conduct towards its own citizens. 16 So, for example, Article 17 would constrain and prohibit Russian attempts to spy on its own citizens, or U.S. attempts to spy on Americans-at least if they are arbitrary or unlawful (lawful or nonarbitrary spying, i.e., authorized by domestic statute, would not necessarily be covered 792 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2015), vacated en banc, 840 F.3d 757 (D.C. Cir. 2016). At issue is how to read the Quirin precedent, given the Court's confusion between international offenses and domestic offenses that are unprivileged. One way of reading Quirin is that the Court upheld jurisdiction of military commissions for domestic offenses (because spying is a domestic offense). Another way of reading the case is that the Court upheld jurisdiction of military commissions for international offenses only, because the Court was laboring under the mistaken view that spying was a direct violation of international law. 15.

                "text": "The other response is an appeal to \"the subsequent practice of the parties\"-a doctrine that encourages reference to the practice of States as a means of treaty interpretation.' Under this methodology, the fact that States all engage in spying-and rarely criticize it as illegal-could be relevant for an interpretation of Article 17 and other treaty provisions. Unfortunately, this methodology is vastly overused in contemporary legal discourse; it is objectionable because it threatens to transform treaty interpretation into a kind of ersatz customary international law analysis (based on State practice). State practice is important but only when the norm flows from custom; when a norm flows from treaty law, State practice ought to fade in relevance. Indeed, even under the interpretive doctrine of the \"subsequent practice of the parties,\" the method should only be used when it is clear that the parties are acting pursuant to the treaty-in all other cases the practice of the parties is not a relevant method for analyzing an ambiguous treaty provision.\" This methodology seems especially ill-suited to analyzing human rights treaties, which demonstrate a unique structure that is not at all analogous to the typical bilateral arrangement. Human rights treaties are multilateral conventions that have individuals as their primary beneficiaries. The fact that most nations ignore their obligations under particular human rights provisions ought not to be an argument that the conduct therefore does not violate a human rights 17.

If Koh is right, though, this would provide one avenue through which to view the Russian interference as unlawful, i.e., a violation of international human rights law.

Then, the State complies with the coercive demand because it finds the promised consequence to be intolerable to live with. A key element here is the assumption that the threatened consequence constitutes an illegal or wrongful action. Although never stated explicitly, this assumption is arguably implicit in the Nicaragua judgment, in part because the court concluded that actions of the United States constituted an illegal use of force under international law. In contrast, if the threatened consequence is an action that the threatening State clearly has the authority under international law to engage in, then the action is merely an example of bald strategic behavior, not coercion per se. So, for example, in the Nicaragua case, the International Court of Justice concluded that the mining of the harbor waters (and support for the Contras) constituted illegal intervention because the United States did not have the right to mine the harbor and the action constituted a use of force in violation of the U.N. Charter and customary law. 34 If, on the other hand, a State mounts a naval blockade in a situation when the blockade is permissible under international law, it cannot count as an example of coercion just because the target of the blockade views the situation as intolerable and therefore capitulates.

Although there is not much law on this question in the burgeoning field of the international law of cyber operations, the issue has been raised and analyzed in numerous other fields, including domestic law and philosophy.

Consider the U.S. Supreme Court's review of Medicaid expansion in NFIB v. Sebelius. 4 1 In Sebelius, the question facing the Court was whether Congress had engaged in impermissible coercion by attaching a condition to the funds that the federal government provides to States for their Medicaid programs. 42 The condition required the States to expand their Medicaid programs or risk losing federal funding for Medicaid entirely (not just for the expansion). 4 3 The Supreme Court had already determined, back in South Dakota v. Dole, that Congress could use its spending power to induce compliance by sovereign States.\" In that case, Congress had tied federal funding for highways to the drinking age, so that States were required to raise their drinking age to twenty-one or risk losing five percent of the funding that they received from the federal [Vol. 95:1579 government for highway projects. 45 The Court ruled that these funding conditions were not unconstitutionally coercive, but did concede that prior \"decisions have recognized that in some circumstances the financial inducement offered by Congress might be so coercive as to pass the point at which 'pressure turns into compulsion.\"' 46 So although the funding scheme in Dole was constitutional, the Court reiterated its holding that the withdrawal of financial benefits could rise to the level of coercion.",

So the majority apparently viewed the total amount as the crucial factor, not the question of whether the threatened consequence was illegal or not. At least in this limited circumstance, a court viewed coercion as applying to a case where the negative consequence was not otherwise illegal or impermissible. In essence, an offer that is too good to refuse may constitute coercion because it seems impossible for the recipient to forego the benefits in question. 4 9 Applying this insight to the case of Russian cyber interference, one might argue that coercion does not necessarily require a threat to commit an ROBERT NOZICK, PHILOSOPHICAL EXPLANATIONS 48 (1981). This insight provides an opening for explaining how the withholding of a benefit could rise to the level of coercion. In that situation, the action produced by the withholding of the benefit might stand in a closer relationship to the coercer's motives and intentions than to the target's motives and intentions. This is certainly the case with regard to the coercive Medicaid expansion, which stood in a closer relationship to Congress's intention than it did to the States' intentions.",

Were they coerced into voting for Trump and not for Clinton? If so, what were the threatened consequences? One might argue that the Russian intervention came with an implied threat to withhold benefits if Hillary Clinton were elected and that Russia would act in a more cooperative manner towards the United States if Trump were elected, perhaps in exchange for reciprocal considerations from a new Trump Administration. Or perhaps one might argue that the hacking came with the threat of future illegal behavior on the part of the Russian government: either more instances of hacking, or more daringly, increased military aggression in places like Crimea or eastern Ukraine. Or, one might assume that the object of the coercion was actually Hillary Clinton. In that regard, perhaps the point was that Clinton was implicitly informed that she should adopt a more conciliatory attitude toward Russia (and drop any attempts to pursue regime change in Russia or oust Putin), and that if she did not comply, the hacking of DNC e-mails would be the threatened consequence. 52 However, it is unclear if this threat or offer was made, either explicitly or implicitly.

This generates a translation problem. The notion of sovereign will described above does not accord with the concept of sovereignty as public international lawyers usually use the term. Of course, the word sovereignty is notoriously slippery and vague and often generates more heat than light. 65 But generally speaking, when a public international lawyer speaks of sovereignty, they mean the right of a State to control its territory, regulate its subjects, and be free from external military aggression, as well as lesser forms of impermissible interventions and interference. 66 Indeed, this is the notion of sovereignty that guided our legal analysis in Parts I and II of this Article. However, we were proceeding under the assumption that the legal notion of sovereignty-and its companion notion of unlawful interventions against sovereignty-was the proper legal framework for understanding an event that politicians and even political theorists would have analyzed with the language (their language) of sovereignty. But this assumption may be false. The best legal analogue for the political concept of sovereignty may not be the legal concept of sovereignty after all.",

First, self-determination is usually invoked as an argument for constructing a State (perhaps through secession), 69 but once a State has been created, the legal discourse usually shifts to State sovereignty and the principle of self-determination fades into the background. But that fading away is not legally required; indeed, a people's right to selfdetermination does not disappear once it succeeds in creating a State to fulfill its self-determination. The concept of State sovereignty does not entirely exhaust the principle of self-determination, which remains an important guiding principle and runs parallel to the legal concept of State sovereignty.",

Widespread noncompliance does not automatically transform the behavior into compliance, the rules of customary international law (via State practice) notwithstanding. More importantly, even if the United States has engaged in such meddling before, it is important to distinguish between political interference in dictatorships and other illiberal systems versus interference in genuinely democratic elections. 72 The former violates the principle of selfdetermination while the latter does not. 73 Indeed, it should count as a virtue of the self-determination rubric that it helpfully distinguishes between interventions that frustrate democratic self-government and interventions that support it.
