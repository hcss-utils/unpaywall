The rate of growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in constant prices has been used as a measure of overall performance. The next section tends to measure the strength of economic ties between Indonesia and South Asia through commodity trade. These links are examined by calculating the export-intensity index, import-intensity index, Grubel-Lloyd index {2] and trade-reciprocity index. The last section discusses the problems and analyses the prospects for strengthening future co-operation between Indonesia and South Asia. The general characteristics of the economies of Indonesia and South Asia are summarised in Table I . The per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1979 in constant prices, which is probably a better indicator of the overall performance of the economies of Indonesia and South Asia, worked out to be the highest (US $ 344) for Indonesia and the lowest (US $ 86) for Bangladesh. As a share of GDP, exports of goods and non-factor services were roughly calculated to be 30 percent for Indonesia. In South Asia, only for Sri Lanka this ratio was around 34 percent. However, as a share of GDP, domestic savings remained roughly at the same level as exports for Indonesia and not for Sri Lanka (14 percent). The last column in Table I shows the resource balance of the countries, which is the difference between exports and imports of goods and non-factor services. Indonesia is the only country having a favourable balance.",

The rates of economic growth of South Asian countries had been low when compared with the rate of growth of Indonesia. The WorldDevelopment Report, 1981 [12] suggests that developing countries could improve on their record of the 1970s, when they grew at 5.1 percent a year. Except Pakistan, all the other South Asian countries, however, had growth rates much below the average growth rate for low-income countries (4.7 percent) given by the Report. It may be noted that Indonesia's oil exports help to insulate its economy from the external influences that affect the oil-importing South Asian countries. Considering the major sectoral growth rate, Indonesia had the highest growth rates for all the sectors when compared with South Asian countries. The high rate of growth in the manufacturing industry in Indonesia was mainly achieved through import substitution. The growth of the other sectors, however, also boosted the domestic demand for industrial (1) ( ",

With the help of Chenery's formula [I] , the factors affecting the growth of domestic production can quantitatively be measured from the existing input-output tables. These factors affecting the growth of domestic production can broadly be classified as exports, import substitution, intermediate demand and domestic final demand. Table 3 givesthe sources of growth for the output of various major industries in Indonesia. The last column of Table 3 revealsthat import substitution seems to be the major factor contributing to the growth of paper, fertilizer and machinery industries. The intermediate demand for chemicals, rubber products and metal products appears to be the major cause for the industrial expansion. The increase in intermediate demand may be due to the increased import-substitution strategy of Indonesia. Comparing the various issues of the World Development Report, an important quantitative association between the rate of economic growth and export performance in terms of the share of GDP can be derived. In the case of Indonesia, there seems to be a positive association between the rate of growth of GDP and the ratio of export performance to GDP. For example, as a share of GDP, exports of goods and non-factor servicesrose from 13 percent in 1960 to 22 percent in 1977 and then to 30 percent in 1979. In the case of South Asian countries, this ratio remained more or less constant from 1960 to 1979. It may further be noted that the South .Asian countries had the averageannual growth rates of exports as the share of GDP and GDP below the average (14 percent and 5.1 percent respectively) for all low-income countries.",

Machinery, transport equipment, manufacturing goods and textiles appear to be the groups of the most common commodities imported by Indonesia and South Asia. Where Indonesia's exports to South Asia are concerned, the existing relationship seems to be very weak and negligible (Table 6 ). On the average, only about 0.5 percent of Indonesia's total exports were destined for South Asia during the 1970-79 period. The percentage share of South Asia in Indonesia's total exports rose slowly and gradually during this period. Even after the 1974 recession, Indonesia's exports to South Asian did not decline in the subsequent periods.

Any country would like to raise the value of its exports which means that the country would receive more imports for its exports. This is true only if exports equal imports. In other words, trade is balanced if the value of exports equals the value of imports. This implies that the net barter term of trade (P /P ) equals the gross barter term of Table 7 that Indonesia's import-value index has increased more than its export-value index with respect to South Asia, and the former is greater than the latter. Tables 8 and 9 show the commodity composition of Indonesia's imports from and exports to South Asia for two years: 1974 (before the recession) and 1978 (after Indonesia's devaluation of the rupiah). It may be noted that there has not been any change in the commodity composition of Indonesia's imports from South Asia, except in the commodity group of Beveragesand Tobacco, which showed a declining trend. Food and live animals were the major commodity groups accounting for 65 percent of total imports from South Asia in 1974 and their percentage increased to 72 in 1978. Though there was a slight decrease in basic manufactures group, the share of machines and transport equipment in Indonesia's total imports increased. Table 9 shows that a change has occurred in the commodity composition of Indonesia's exports to South Asia. The share of animal and vegetable oils and fat in the Indonesian exports to South Asia has decreased. The share of chemicals in Indonesia's total exports to South Asia, on the other hand, has increased remarkably from 0.1 percent to 27 percent. Increases in the exports of machine, transport equipment and miscellaneous manufactured goods were also observed during this period of analysis. Tables 10-13 ...... Table 12 Vallie of Indonesia's Trade with Pakistan by Commodity Sections trend. Bangladesh and Sri Lanka appear to be strengthening their trade ties with Indonesia gradually. In summing up the commodity composition of Indonesia's trade with South Asian countries, we note that India and Pakistan were the major suppliers and consumers, and the supply and consumption mainly consisted of food and live animals, and animal and vegetable oils and fat respectively.",

The import (export) intensity of trade of one country with another may be defined as the ratio of the share of country j in the total imports (exports) of country i to the share of country j in the total world exports (imports) net of country i's share. The import-intensity index [5] An index with a value of either I, or greater than I or less than I implies that country j is equally represented, over-represented or under-represented respectively in country i's imports (exports). Table 14 gives Indonesia's import-and export-intensity indices for Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka for the period from 1970 to 1979. Because of the insignificant imports from Bangladesh, Indonesia's import-intensity index worked out to be zero for the period. In 1970, Indonesia's import-intensity index for India was calculated to be less than I, indicating that India was under-represented in Indonesia's imports. Indonesia's import-intensity index for India, however, slowly increased in subsequent years and it was around 4.3 in 1979. There was no consistent pattern of movement of Indonesia's import-intensity index for Pakistan for the 1970-79 period. The index was as high as 6.7 in 1970 for Pakistan but then went down to 0. . . . . . imports from India, and economic complementarity may be a possible reason. With Sri Lanka it appeared that Indonesia did not have a consistent pattern of imports. On consolidating the above calculations, it may be noted that Indonesia has increased her imports from India and has considerable imports from Pakistan. Indonesia's~xport-intensity indices for Bangladeshand Sri Lanka were gradually increasing, which shows that for Indonesia these two South Asian countries could be potential consumers of growing importance. Indonesia's exports to India showed an inconsistent trend and were not significant compared to the magnitude of Indonesia's import-intensity index for India. The picture that is provided by Pakistan is different. Pakistan was the major consumer of Indonesia's exports from 1973 to 1979. Generally, Indonesia's export intensity was weaker and smaller than her import intensity for India and Pakistan.",

The measure of intraindustry trade used by Grubel and Lloyd [2] has been calculated to measure Indonesia's bilateral trade relations with individual South Asian countries. It is expressed as the ratio of the value of exports which is matched by imports to the total value of exports and imports of an industry. That is The measures should be, by definition, varying between 0 and 1. When exports exactly equal imports of an industry, {3= 1, and where there are exports but no imports or vice versa, {3i= O. Whenever exports equal one-half of imports or vice versa, {3i= 0.67. The higher the ratio, the greater the intra-industry trade and vice versa. In calculating the intra-industry trade index, the 3-digit SITC has been used to disaggregatethe data for the years 1970, 1974 and 1979. For the year 1970, calculations yielded zero values for the selected SITC. For the year 1974, calculations showed full of zero values except for SITC 332. With Pakistan the intra-industry trade index for SITC 332 worked out to be 0.16. For SITC 74, SITC 292 (Sri Lanka), SITC 422, and SITC 541, there were Indonesian exports with no imports from Pakistan and India. For the year 1979, the intraindustry indices were all zero for the relevant SITC. For SITC 74, SITC 121, SITC 242, SITC 422 and SITC 561, there were exports with no imports from South Asia. '\"",

Intra-industry trade deals with differentiated products which are close substitutes belonging to the same product group. Inter-industry trade, on the other hand, refers to trade in different products. The zero values of the intra-industry trade indices mean that there is only inter-industry trade between Indonesia and South Asia, and it then becomes necessary to measure the degree of reciprocity in trade relations between Indonesia and South Asia.

Prior to 1973, Indonesia used to have a complicated regime of high tariffs, quotas and other restrictions in imports, resulting in a highly protected manufacturing sector. In addition to import taxes, institutional barriers to entry of imports further enhance the level of protection. These barriers stem from the proliferation of import controls and procedures and their arbitrary enforcement, which effectively delayed and restricted easy entry. A major reform in the tariff system took place in 1973 when tariffs were revised and simplified. The revision revealsthat the nominal rates of protection have been increased for almost all sectors, 10 percent or more of whose total demand is imported. The effective rates of protection, however, experienced both declining and increasing trends during the periods of comparison. Consumergoods sectors bear higher rates of effective protection than capital goods and intermediate industries [7] . These tariff structures are, therefore, likely to have adverse effects on imports from South Asia, especially from Pakistan, as they comprised mainly consumer goods such as food and live animals.",
