Drawing on this processual approach, Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck (2008) , for example, develops 'phase models of mediatization' in which he conceptualizes 'mediatization' as multidimensional and inherently process-oriented. The perspective on mediatization as an ongoing development, which can be characterized by specific phases, grasps the dynamics of the overall process, but does not account sufficiently for the specific dynamics in certain arenas of mediatization. In this article we want to argue that some sectors, environments or contexts (arenas) undergo specific processes of mediatization in respect of categories like intensity, time and societal impact, to name but a few. Certain arenas can be more or less dynamically mediatized than others. Politics, for example, cannot be thought of beyond media any more. As shown by the dynamics of several election campaigns worldwide, for instance, the Obama campaign (Thimm, 2012) , as well as the recent revolutionary movements in North Africa and the Middle East, new media especially have become a crucial part of global political developments. Political information and public opinions evolve from various media and are influenced by the corresponding media features.",

As Miller (in this volume) rightly observes, much theorizing has failed to consider technology, so that there is 'an awkward gap in mediatization theory, made worse by limited treatments of technology that are ambivalent and even contradictory'.",

One of these moulding forces is the technological frame in which communicative actions manifest. The technological frames are enablers and disablers at the same time -they offer, or even create, new ways of communication and interaction with the help of technology, but they restrict options at the same time by setting limiting regulations of usage. These regulations have been discussed more recently under the heading of the 'power of algorithms' (Dang-Anh, Einsp\u00e4nner and Thimm, in press; Pariser, 2011) .",

Marked by characteristics like ubiquity, produsage (Bruns, 2008) , multimediality and, more recently, portability (Chayko, 2008) , the internet has gained increasing influence on mediatization processes. In personal routines like online shopping, information seeking, social networking or gaming, online technologies pick up on many human needs and interests by offering online options. But not only are private habits influenced by online cultures; the public sphere is undergoing changes as well. Most notably, citizens all over the world have been taking their protests to the internet. Most prominently during the so-called Arab Spring in 2011 (Tufekci and Wilson, 2012) , but also during a political scandal in Italy (Vicari, 2012) and in a local conflict about a traffic project in Germany (Thimm and B\u00fcrger, 2012) , citizens have used online media to voice their protest. Even in China, online activities on Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent to Twitter, have started to gain watchdog functions (Hassid, 2012) .",

Given the ever-increasing pace of political decisionmaking and the globalized forces of control that seem to dictate much of life around the world, many citizens, whether politically active or not, have a feeling of being alienated from decisions that affect their lives. In these circumstances, the internet in particular has seemed to many a potential antidote. Consequently, the internet raised high hopes as a two-way, manyto-many medium with the potential to open communication to almost everyone in a medium that is not centrally controlled and that is flexible enough to facilitate citizen action (Delli Carpini, Cook and Jacobs, 2004) . The increasing socio-communicative functionalities, particularly of social networks like Facebook, Twitter or YouTube, have also spawned new forms of mediatized political communication.

Imagine technology and democracy uniting to overcome distance and time, bringing participation, deliberation, and choice to citizens at the time and place of their choosing. Goodbye, then, to 'attack ads' and single-issue politics -and to dimpled chads. E-democracy will return the political agenda to citizens. Or so the dream goes. (Culver, 2003) For designers, scholars and practitioners, the term 'online deliberation' holds many different meanings. Words or phrases like 'consensus', 'participation', 'access to information', 'voting', 'project management', 'learning' and 'collaboration' inflect the vocabularies used by those developing, assessing or disseminating digital technologies that facilitate deliberation (Davies, 2009) . For many, talk of online deliberation is synonymous with talk of changing or improving democracy and seeing it work via digital media. For others, online deliberation is concentrated on certain tools, which enable participation online (like Fishkin's online polling tolls; see Fishkin, 1991; .",

Dahlgren (2005) stresses, for example, that 'the theme of internet and the public sphere now has a permanent place on research agendas and in intellectual inquiry for the foreseeable future' in both the media and political communication research, leading eventually to 'convergences between mass and interactive media' (p. 41). Public deliberation online emerges in the new social context of everyday life, but is independent of the existing social settings and conventions. By going online, civic interaction and deliberation expand and pluralize the existing systems of political communication, allowing the expression of socio-political concerns to everyone, not only to political elites.",

Particularly on Twitter, with its flat communicative structures, we see a limited, yet vast, potential for discursive participation in terms of a fundamental publicness, individuality, general freedom of expressing and selecting sources, and eventually (and ideally) reasoning on political issues.",

The 140-character format may be seen as a constraint, but it is actually no limitation at all (Boyd, Golder and Lotan, 2010) : Tweets can be shortened or modified by their distributors and extended by inserted informational links. Because of being so short, Twitter communication is often regarded as being catchy and comprehensible. Additionally, the user is able to substantiate his statement by adding embedded multimodal content (photos, videos and links to other websites), for instance, uploading a picture as evidence of a particular newsworthy situation (Liu, Palen, Sutton, Hughes and Vieweg, 2008) . Inserted hyperlinks to online articles or blogpostings can provide additional background information and help to create a discourse system. This system is based on four operators: @ for addressing or mentioning, # for tagging, http:// for linking and RT for republishing. These operators serve different functions and communicative strategies and can be conceptualized in the 'Functional operator model of Twitter' (see Thimm, Dang-Anh and Einsp\u00e4nner, 2011) .",

Using the @-function as an interactional 'cross-turn coherence' (Honeycutt and Herring, 2009, p. 2) gives users more options to take part in political online discourses (e.g., @-initiated interaction between citizens and politicians). On the functional level, these actions serve the strategies of 'direct and indirect addressing'. By @-mentioning, that is, putting the '@' somewhere else than at the beginning of a tweet, users talk about each other, creating attention and raising awareness of the subject in question in two ways. First, the addressed or mentioned user becomes aware of being addressed or mentioned, resulting in a potential response. Second, users following the initial tweeter also become aware of the addressed user being talked about or to. This opens up conversational potential for multi-level interaction with several participants involved. Furthermore, it constitutes @-interactions as genuinely public.",

By empowering the users all over the world to document, observe, comment or criticize, this social network has the potential to influence political discourse, as was shown by the above examples from the field. Twitter can already be regarded as an establishment within the mediatized world of politics. In a manner of discursive participation, users can share political news and opinions, organize political support or demand more participation from their governments. On the other hand, politicians themselves can address criticism personally and enter public discussion with other users. The global trend towards mobile phones additionally opens up local incidents to the world, as mobile online access enables citizens to immediately report news to the global public (Thimm and B\u00fcrger, 2012) . Consequently, the dynamics of Twitter usage can be regarded as a pacemaker for the mediatization of politics.",

From a deliberative point of view, there are no elaborated discourse procedures on Twitter fixed by rules. Conversational regularities are created out of certain usage cultures, such as the hashtags referring to other users. For example, follower recommendations can be marked by '#ff'. Regarding the communicative functionalities, Twitter itself sets the rules by its program code and offers a stable communication environment, but at the same time limits interactive creativity.When applying these five dimensions to concrete Twitter activities, different perspectives can be taken for text analysis. Subsequently, we present three approaches based on the analysis of a large corpus of tweets collected during the 2010-12 state elections in Germany.<xen> 1 </xen> Bases of analysis are tweets posted by politicians, citizens ('public sphere') and media accounts during four state elections in Germany. The data is summarized inTable 15.1: For analysis, the following categories were chosen: <list> (a)",

At the individual level, our operator model of Twitter allows a systematic approach of operator usage and frequency as markers of individual styles. Especially for politicians interacting with citizens, this perspective becomes relevant. (c) Discursive participation on the interactive exchange level: Direct discursive exchanges between interactants reflect the dyadic approach to deliberation. For this perspective, direct exchanges on Twitter are taken as 'deliberative discussions', which demonstrate the discursive options of microblogging.</list> For the analysis, a triangulate approach was chosen: a quantitative (1) and a qualitative (2) content analysis as well as a linguistic tweet analysis (3). The quantitative analysis is used in order to evaluate interpersonal interaction (@replies and @retweets) on the basis of the functional operator model (see Figure 15.1). Frequency counts of the specific Twitter elements and the analysis of their co-occurrences lead to different types of Twitter communication (activity profiles, tweeting styles). In addition, not only were the most frequently discussed topics during the evaluation periods counted, but all hashtag-based discourses on the interactive level, identifying specific communicative actions and interaction structures (e.g., types of reference, topic management), were assessed. With this multi-method approach, tweets can be analysed with regard to quantitative and qualitative qualities. In addition, the social exchange between the participants within a politically motivated Twitter discourse can be categorized. The results discussed below were selected to highlight these functionalities in the context of deliberation structures. <list> (a) Topic frequency: The most interesting results were obtained during state elections in Baden-Wuerttemberg. Here, not only #Fukushima (red line) and nuclear power (#akw, blue line) but a local traffic project in the state capital of Stuttgart (#s21, yellow line) were the top topics. Particularly on the day of the election (March 27, 2011), the high peak of #s21 shows intense activity. This is important insofar as the Green Party fervently fought against this traffic project and won the election, overthrowing the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) after 50 years of uninterrupted power in this state.</list>",
