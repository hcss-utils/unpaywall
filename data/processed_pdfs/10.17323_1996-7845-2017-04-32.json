The national S&T priorities for countries are systemized and a comparative assessment of capacities for S&T development in BRICS countries is developed. Indicators of publication activity of all BRICS countries have significantly increased since 2000. Analysis shows that Russia must pay particular attention to the development of cooperation with China, which is already one of the leaders on the global S&T stage. Cooperation with India, Brazil and, in some research areas, with South Africa could also have a positive impact on the performance of research and development in Russia. A list of 14 thematic priorities for S&T cooperation for BRICS countries is presented in the paper based on the analysis of a set of national, bilateral and multilateral strategic and forward-looking documents. Priorities of S&T development create a basis for more efficient and mutually beneficial cooperation between BRICS countries and allows individual scientists to broaden the range of research, use new tools for S&T cooperation and share best practices.",

This was largely due to the exceptionally high growth in Chinese publication activity. In 2000-2015, the number of publications by Chinese authors grew 8.5 times, while the overall growth rate of global publication activity in the last five years has declined. Accordingly, between 2000-2015, China has moved up from 6 th to 2 nd place in terms of total publications. Due to its relatively high growth in publication activity over recent years, China has managed to come much closer to the US, which has recently displayed a rather low growth in publication numbers. The number of Russian publications indexed in Scopus grew just 1.86 times in 2001-2015, with the bulk of growth occurring over the last five years. Despite that fact, Russia has moved down in the \"Number of publications\" rating from 9 th to 13 th place in the same period. In 2000-2012, the number of publications by Russian researchers remained at about 30-38 thousand a year, and only in recent years has Russian publication activity begun to increase rapidly. India, and to a lesser extent Brazil, along with China displays a high growth rate of publication activity. The number of publications by Brazilian authors indexed in Scopus in 2000-2015 grew from 14.1 thousand to 62.0 thousand. In the global \"Number of publications\" rating, Brazil moved up from 17 th place in 2000 to 14 th in 2015. In 2000-2015, the number of Indian Scopus-indexed publications has grown from 23.5 thousand to 122 thousand. South Africa is also showing a rapidly growing rate of publication activity. However, the high growth rate is largely due to the \"low start\" effect. The number of publications by South African researchers grew 3.75 times from 2000 to 2015, 4.6 thousand to 17.1 thousand. In the overall \"Number of publications\" rating, South Africa is low in the top 40. Generally, in 2015, BRICS countries produced almost 29% of the world's total number of Scopus-indexed publications; of which; China contributed 18%, India -5%, Russia and Brazil -2.6% each, and South Africa -0.72% (see table 4 ). In terms of the total number of Scopusindexed publications, BRICS countries came very close to the EU28 (30.5% of the world's total in 2015). South Africa shows the most active involvement in international research cooperation among all BRICS countries ( Table 5 ). Since 2005, more than 40% of the nation's Scopus-indexed publications were co-authored with scientists from other countries. Note that the share of internationally co-authored publications in South Africa has been growing over the last five years. In Russia, the share of internationally co-authored publications for the last 15 years has remained at 25-35%. Note that in Russia, unlike South Africa, China, and Brazil, this figure has been steadily decreasing in recent years -from 33.6% in 2005 to 25.5% in 2015. The level of participation by Brazilian scientists in international research cooperation was somewhat lower than in Russia (25-20% during the last 15 years). As in South Africa, the share of internationally co-authored publications by Brazilian researchers has grown in the last 5 years (from 23.9 to 30.1%). In India and China, scientists are integrated into international research cooperation to a lesser extent than in other BRICS countries (the relevant figure is about 15-20% for the last 15 years). In the last 5 years, China has managed to increase its share of internationally co-authored publications from 14.6% in 2010 to 20.2% in 2015. In India, the relevant figure has slightly dropped during the same period, from 18.5% in 2005 to 16.6% in 2015. At the same time, Asian countries with advanced research systems tend to display rather low participation in international scientific cooperation, for example, in 2015 only 20.9% of Scopus-indexed publications by Iranian authors were internationally co-authored; for Turkey the figure was 21.1%, for Japan -26.6%, for the Republic of Korea -26.5% [HSE, 2017] .",

The results of our analysis allowed a number of prospective S&T areas to be identified in which BRICS countries may be interested in stepping up bilateral and multilateral cooperation and thus more efficiently implement their own national priorities. The similarity of S&T and innovation development priorities within BRICS countries is a major factor in promoting the establishment of sustainable long-term partnerships between them. Furthermore, recent cooperative practice shows that such partnerships tend to strengthen the participants, specifically in the scope of projects implemented in priority subject areas, with the potential to produce significant economic and social effects. Cooperation between BRICS countries becomes more efficient and productive the more it covers all stages of the innovation cycle -from creating new basic knowledge to its practical application -new technology, products, and services. This implies that such stages may be \"distributed\" between BRICS countries, in line not only with their respective S&T priorities but also their production potential. Subsequently, an information database could be created on the basis of the obtained results to support the various participants in national innovation systems, so that they would quickly be able to identify suitable subject areas for S&T cooperation with other BRICS countries, find partners (including R&D organisations, universities, industrial enterprises specialising in various sectors of the economy, etc.), and identify the best formats and mechanism for cooperation. Acting in the international arena as a single group, BRICS countries could become a global node of advanced STI development.",
