                "text": "The EEAS employs different means of communication, reflecting the variation of the audiences it aims to reach. The EEAS website is one such tool, both a means in its own right and a gateway to a rich variety of communication channels and forms. Ashton and top EEAS officials give speeches, and her staff issues statements and provides news. 6 Presumably they are involved in drafting both Council of Ministers and European Council conclusions. Ashton might also, as Vice-President of the European Commission, be involved in authorizing mandates for white papers, green papers, communications and other kinds of policy documents. 7 This article aims at understanding the significance of this kind of institutional communication and how it resonates with existing discourses on foreign affairs. It does so by bridging two avenues of research: one avenue focusing on relations between elite and public, and a second avenue focusing on foreign policy traditions -thus illustrating some of the arguments that Caterina Carta and Jean-Frederic Morin have emphasized (Introduction to this special issue). 8 In research on the relationship between foreign policy and public opinion, Gabriel Almond's (1960) distinction between a 'general public', an 'attentive public' and a 'policy and opinion elite' has proved to be of lasting value. 9 According to Almond's slightly provocative claim, the general public does not understand and, in any case, does not care about foreign policy, except perhaps during crises. The attentive public is a fairly exclusive and educated segment of the general public, and the elite can interact with the attentive public, at least in terms of more general or abstract reasoning. The policy and opinion elite comprises several groupings -diplomats, journalists, politicians, academics -who know to various degrees the insights and rationales of policies and are thus in a perfect position to interact within the elite as well as with the attentive public.",

How does the policy and opinion elite articulate European foreign policy to the attentive public? Which abstract idioms, symbols or (historical) analogies are being employed, and which idioms are typically at the hearts and minds of the attentive public? In this context, the article examines the issue of contested discourses between, within and especially across EU member states, arguing that significant insight can be gained by means of analysing contested discourses within member states, including the degree to which these discourses have a transnational nature. In this respect, the article focuses on themes similar to those analysed by Caterina Carta and Thomas Diez (both in this special issue), even if the approach is slightly different. Subsequently, the article explicates two key terms, public philosophy and mythology, highlighting their crucial importance for the objectives of this article. The article then turns to what could be labelled 'discursive shareware', i.e. the overlaps that exist between different levels and segments of discourse.",

Moreover, it focuses on only one dimension of contested policy, i.e., it highlights how foreign policy is contested among EU member states and downplays different worldviews and preferred foreign policy directions within member states. Finally, it somehow downplays processes of Europeanization, that is, the impact of Europe on member states' institutions and policymaking processes.

It is nothing else but overwhelming in terms of scholarship (Hudson 19952005) . Reaching back to the 1950s, it has a long tradition and a mutually constitutive relationship with International Relations as a discipline; given the incredible range of approaches and theories within FPA, it can be considered an analytical goldmine that awaits its European golddiggers; its numerous examples of best practice studies suggest it should be an obligatory first stop source of inspiration. However, interfaces between the FPA tradition and research on European foreign policy are very limited (Carlsnaes and Smith 1994; White, 2001; Carlsnaes, White and Sjursen eds. 2004; Carlsnaes 2007) . It seems that the two parties never entered a lasting or giving relationship. Matchmakers have been few, prime representatives of the tradition have never found the EU case particularly attractive, this in stark contrast to the case of the United States. By contrast, scholars in Europe tend to find the FPA tradition too US-centric, too positivist and too state-centric. Scholars in Europe tend to abandon the analytical rigidness of FPA and embrace a kind of analytical realist naturalism (as understood within the arts).",

Carr in 1939 engaged in criticism of liberalism, especially what he called utopian idealism, he was first and foremost criticizing a distinct foreign policy tradition in Europe (Carr, 2001 (Carr, [1939 ). His target was British liberal internationalism, but the tradition was not unknown on the European continent, e.g. in France, Scandinavia and elsewhere. By contrast, it had been effectively repressed in Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain and other countries where authoritarian or totalitarian rule had been introduced. E.H. Carr did not only criticize, he criticized from a position: pleading for appeasement, i.e. a distinct form of limited engagement (Haslam, 2000; Sylvest, 2007; . Hans Morgenthau (1946) phrased Carr's message slightly differently but the target was identical, though extended to include also, and perhaps especially, the American (Wilsonian) liberal tradition. When Jean-Yves Haine 2009criticizes European liberal internationalism, he essentially replicates Carr's and Morgenthau's criticisms, though he situates his analysis and criticism in the early 21 st century.",

There is a long discursive line from Norman Angell's criticism of power politics, via Ernst Haas' criticism of the notion of balance of power, to Mario Bettati and Bernard Kouchner's (1987) argument for an international right to intervene, provided interventions are prompted by humanitarian concerns. A fairly similar reasoning is behind R2P, the newly established principle of a responsibility to protect (see Knudsen, 2013) . Terry Nardin (2006) has eminently examined how such a right can possibly be supported by philosophical arguments, i.e. at the level that in the present context is of most relevance. Others have examined R2P concerning more operational policy concerns, thus overlooking that the prime function of R2P is organizing the politics of prevention and intervention, not to determine whether intervention in Darfur is more urgent than in Libya or the appropriate balance between intervention and prevention (for a critical overview of these debates, see Chandler 2009 ). While we should expect the principled positions to appear in debates on operational issues, we should not expect too much determinism. For the present purposes, identifying the contours of broad schools of thought, a few additional examples suffice.",

When examining the foreign policy thinking within Le Pen's Front National, among UKIPs, segments of British Conservatives, Vaclav Klauses and Kazcinskis, Lega Nordists, Vlaams Blok and Scandinavian progress parties, studies consistently conclude that their discourse is not only directed at their political opponents but also at the institutions that have been built and are occupied by political opponents (see Swyngedouw et al., 2007) . Studies also conclude that isolationist populists generally do not care about global affairs, except when certain debates (for example, border issues) can be politicized.

The domain of myth is not empirical reality but imagination, and the source of its sustenance is not reason but faith. One of the functions of myth is to provide people with a deeper story, a narrative that can encompass their own individual stories and give them meaning, worth, and hope, connected by something more than mere contingency (2009: 5).",

At this level, we find distinct national symbols and mythologies (see \uf0b7 At the European level, we also find mythologies at work, for instance 'Europe as a model', 'European values', 'civilian/normative power', 'a global front-runner' (not so often 'leader'!), 'beyond power politics' (although slippages into the language of power politics can also be seen, for example the Laeken Declaration referring to a multipolar world), 'responsibility', (and in a bygone world: Europe providing a 'standard of civilization', cf. Gong 1984) . Each of these mythological concepts plays a role in and is connected to the public philosophies characterizing foreign policy traditions. For representatives of foreign policy traditions, the usefulness of the concepts varies (exactly because discourses are essentially contested, cf. arguments by Thomas Diez in this special issue). 'Europe as a model' is useful for isolationists who prefer Europe not to do too much of anything in foreign affairs. For them it is sufficient to be (a model). Moreover, the concept is compatible with a liberal mindset because Europe is constructed as a (liberal) vanguard, characterized by (liberal) European values which, obviously, this group aims to project worldwide. So far, the EEAS seems first and foremost to have been settling in,physically and organizationally, and therefore not that successful in terms of engaging the attentive European public by means of mythology. Some might want to consider the Nobel Peace Prize 2013 a contribution to European mythology in foreign affairs, but the reason for giving the European Union the prize was primarily Euro-centric, making one of the most violent continents peaceful, and not so much in recognition of European foreign policy.",

It is not only the UN that provides norms and principles for the EU to download. Within the field of development policy, the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and the World Bank perform a similar function (Carroll and Kellow, 2013) . Within the field of nonproliferation, the EU has proved to be very active in downloading norms and principles, yet has demonstrated limited capacity to make and implement policies (van Ham, 2011; Kienzle and Vestergaard, 2013) . These examples illustrate the significance of discourses in international affairs, but also the fact that the EU does not always speak. Sometimes, the EU listens, and adopts or adapts to global norms. Institutions at the sub-global level also play a role, for example NATO's role as a model for the EU in defence matters and the role of the United States in triggering the rationale for the 2003 European Security Strategy (Biscop, 2005) , including its emphasis on WMD and terrorism as main threats to European security.",

In Europe, the AP seems to be rather compartmentalized, partly because each level has its distinct constituencies, partly because communication tends to take place in different languages and, finally, because the European foreign policy tradition has been cultivated at a certain distance from both the general and the attentive public. Notably, the tradition in question is different from what is otherwise referred to as tradition in this article. 12 However, compartmentalization can also be exaggerated. Differences between globalization, mondialization and globalisierung do not seem that impressive, even if connotations can be significantly different. Moreover, it is not that different from the US case, where interplays between different levels also occur. Finally, even if the European AP does exist, it might be that it is not fully conscious of its own existence-though in February, when a considerable segment of the AP demonstrated throughout Europe against the Iraq War, it demonstrated its presence (Habermas and Derrida 2003) . It should be noted that I take a European perspective on compartmentalization, that is, how European citizens are divided into a number of segments among which some are nationally defined whereas others are defined by foreign policy traditions. Though Nicholas Aylott (2002) also analyze compartmentalization, he focuses on how Scandinavian parties compartmentalize European integration issues, for instance by means of referenda, suspension of party discipline and sequencing different party goals (office, policies, voters, unity) . While Aylott's analyzes the strategic behaviour of social democratic parties in a national context, I focus on the normative superstructure that the policy and opinion elite employs when presenting reasons for action. With such a focus my explanandum concerns the issue of how action templates, including world-views, principled beliefs and causal beliefs (cf. Hudson 1999; Brommesson 2010) are reflected in public discourses. While these discourses rarely follow party division lines, indeed that is one of the reasons party leaders employ compartmentalization in the sense used by Aylott, the discourses do provide bridges of understanding between the POE and the AP. Research on the two types of compartmentalization seems therefore complementary rather than competitive. A joint research agenda appears therefore highly promising.",

However, they do help us to better understand reasons for action, i.e., the process of legitimizing European foreign policy. As foreign policy is a broad church, all sorts of reasons come into play, for instance an ethics of responsibility, obligations we owe to a third-party or to ourselves as Europeans, historical analogies (e.g. European integration as the antithesis to European power politics ), the dialectical construction of Self and Others (anti-Americanism, anti-Muslim, anti-Soviet, libertarian heavens). In this fashion, public philosophies help us understand how the politics of foreign policy is organized. In order to do so it might be helpful to employ the notions of uploading and downloading. When actors make reference to a certain public philosophy they download for instance principles that guide operational policy-making. By contrast, uploading happens when a foreign policy instrument is turned into a principle, when means become ends an end. Thus, negotiations can be considered a means in the conduct of foreign affairs, yet can also be turned into an end in itself, for instance opposing the employment of coercive means. The notions of uploading and downloading can be traced back to the early theories of European integration, cf. neofunctionalism and its focus on the likelihood of national competences being uploaded to a European political community. Over time such uploading might be followed by processes of downloading, cf. the effects of international institutions in neoliberal institutionalism (Keohane 1989) or the effects of the Euro-polity on national institutions and processes of policy-making (B\u00f6rzel 2002) .They help us understand how the politics of foreign policy is organized.",

There might occasionally have been certain tensions between representatives of foreign policy traditions and professional diplomats, but the new challenge is very different. Parts of the European attentive public subscribe to international actors and communicators, and sometimes the EU chooses to do the same. Hence, the EU is not only a nation writ large, projecting its values and interests. It is also a micro-cosmos of the world, reflecting the global normative superstructure in a second-image reversed fashion. 13 The EU might be the world region that most consistently contributes and subscribes to global norms and, in addition, seeks to promote these norms globally.",

According to Stefan Lehne (2011), these statements sometimes happen to be mere empty words, issued in order to appear as a significant player but without the substance necessary to issue statements of consequence. The same applies to the minutes of European Parliament debates, in part because Members of the European Parliament have only limited interest in or responsibility for European foreign policy. Academic books and articles are generally too academic and do not necessarily contribute to legitimizing European foreign policy. European media tends to either believe that there is nothing of significance to report, or to make the EEAS as such (or other institutions) the theme of their stories, not the politics or specific policies (for academic studies of the EEAS, see Barber, 2010; Duke, 2010; Vanhoonacker and Reslow, 2011; Carta, this special issue) . While the media find member states' criticisms of the EEAS worthy to report, they find considerably less 'news quality' in policy reviews of, e.g., the European Neighbourhood Policy. Importantly, the policy and opinion elite is a composite entity. Its policy segment is collective in decision-making (when decisions are possible), yet often separate when legitimizing political positions and actions. Legitimizing is not often, 'Why did we decide to take European foreign policy in direction X' but rather, 'How I managed to safeguard aspect Y, precious to all of us, the people of country Z'. Despite the fact that the policy and opinion elite is a composite entity and that the national representatives typically do not contribute to European discourse, and that European media are not a channel for communication, some exceptions do exist. Books by Chris Patten, Robert Cooper, David Spence, Joschka Fischer, Simon Nuttall and many others contribute to the genesis of a European public sphere in the field of foreign affairs. Likewise, it would be possible to analyse the changing discourses over time of, e.g., Relex Commissioners, Development or Trade Commissioners and, not to be forgotten, High Representatives. Similarly, all EPC, CFSP and E/CSDP statements and declarations are available, though never systematically analysed (whether by means of content analysis or discourse analysis). For some reason, analysts have either avoided analysing political discourse or have uncritically reproduced it, e.g. writing about the EU's strategies vis-\u00e0-vis country X, Y or Z without even attempting to use the term 'strategy'",

Other segments of the media tend to follow national politicians' example and, perhaps with a view to segments of media markets, tell their readers 'the national story', the story from the perspective of country X or the 'what's in it for us' story.

Over time, ever more policy areas have been included in the politics of European foreign policy, and ever more dense discursive fabrics are being woven by the policy and opinion elite. In other words, an ever-more impressive dataset avails itself for analysis. However, relatively few analysts have engaged in this field of research. While the dynamics of policymaking have been documented in numerous studies, the dynamics of the politics of European foreign policy has attracted limited interest. 15 This article has pointed to potential points of departure, including a focus on foreign policy traditions and the public philosophies, mythologies and world views they make use of. Drawing on Almond's classic study, a distinction was made between, on the one hand, the policy and opinion elite and, on the other hand, the public (divided into the attentive and the general public). Moreover, the analytical perspective was changed from the one characterizing the dominant (vertical) mode of analysis to a horizontal perspective on the politics of European foreign policy. Subsequently, the article outlined analytical potentials, that is, reflections on the feasibility of a number of avenues of research. While not underestimating the degree to which the policy and opinion elite as well as the attentive public are compartmentalized, it was argued that Almond's concept is applicable in studies of the politics of European foreign policy. Moreover, the article pointed to the promise of engaging analytically with the discursive practices of the EEAS and other key European institutions. not action templates within states. Hagan examines linkages between domestic politics and decision to go to war. The latter focus is thus more cut to size than the one examined in this article whereas the former provides a much broader focus than my focus on public philosophies and mythology. 15 Studies of the discursive processes of constructing European foreign policy might well benefit from studies of the spatial and temporal dimensions of foreign policy. Whereas research on the so-called areas of concentration in foreign policy (the profile of foreign policy actors) can contribute to the spatial dimension, studies of the temporal dimension are capable of contributing important insights to the merger between temporal and discursive features (on time, see Ekengren 1996 ; on phases, see Smith 2012).",

There is a detectable overlap between the two perspectives, for instance in terms of Europe's role in legitimizing global norms and, sometimes trigger conflicts on normative issues.14 It is not only the application of Almonds categories that cause challenges but also the studies within foreign policy analysis that examine the role of perceptions and culture (see for instanceHagan 1994 andHudson 1999).

Some Danish examples would be '1864', 'never again a 9 th April', 'foreign policy activism', 'a small, open economy', 'neutralism' (especially vis-\u00e0-vis European great powers), 'footnote policy', 'something on heroes'. Beyond Danish borders, these categories do not necessarily make much sense, but they play a key role in constitutingthe imagined community of Danes and their dominant modes of politics. Research on Danish foreign policy tends to reify the tradition by reproducing distinct moments and symbols -and in turn explains why Denmark or at least Danish governments and segments of the attentive public at times have certain problems with European foreign policy. Though the specifics are presumably different, other countries also have their fabric of symbols and mythologies.",
