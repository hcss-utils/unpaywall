The choice of discourse forms the insights and visions of a general education and democratic Bildung as well as leadership. It is our basic thesis that education is closely related to school organisation and leadership as well as civilisation and culture. The trends and tendencies in education and leadership are found through social analytical strategies in the following categories: discourse context, visions, themes, processes and leadership. A general trend in the next four articles is that they focus on relations between national, local and institutional agencies. The governance of municipalities and of schools is analysed in the light of the distinction between a civic society (characterised by the marketplace, governance, formal rules, technocracy, etc.) and cultures (comprising language, communication, cultural understanding, etc.).",

This article discusses why improving Nordic schools from the outside seems to be challenging. It is argued that understanding differences in national contexts is pivotal, and some essential characteristics of the Nordic culture are identified. A strong tradition of collaboration between managers and workers and the tradition of collaboration at work are embedded in a broader Nordic culture characterised by democracy, an egalitarian, collectivist culture, and a high level of trust. However, teachers are rarely included in developmental planning. As a result, the article contributes to an interpretive understanding of educational systems on their own terms, from the inside out.",

Joint leadership is a sub-form of shared leadership between managers characterised by complete formal authority, hierarchic equality and merged work tasks. In previous research, the sharing of a principal's position has been identified as potentially favourable for principals and schools as it reduces the heavy workload to which principals are often exposed. The analysis concludes that the prohibition of such collaboration between principals is due to both distrust between levels of the governing line and uninformed notions of leadership among legislators.",

On the other hand, the prerequisites for doing a good job are connected more to everyday coping with emerging dynamic complexity and communicative diversity. The result shows that practice entails more uncertainty, surprise and event-driven activity than the kind of control and intention-driven activity that characterises thinking in technocratic homogenisation.",

An Actor-Network Theory (ANT) analysis positions the PoV as an actor that may transform, distort or modify meaning or elements.

These global developments can only be managed by critical, constructive and responsible individuals and citizens with a sense of personal identity and cultural belonging, socially responsible individuals who are capable of recognising the needs of others. In other words, people who are capable of active, democratic citizenship supported by traditional ideals of a Bildung-centred education. Instead, researchers have witnessed an expansion of instrumental education policies, curricular developments oriented towards performative competences, and accountability-based leadership and evaluation practices. Paradoxically, these policies run the risk of intensifying precisely those developments which are regarded as counterproductive.
